 # Customer Details

The Customer area is where you can add, edit, and delete customer information.

From here you can edit account information, locations, contacts, equipment, notes, pictures, pools, service, work orders and billing.

Across the bottom of the screen you'll find tabs for the customer whose name is at the top of the screen.

 At the top right there will be a plus and a search icon. The plus is for adding new information, the search is for looking for a new customer.
