Under the Sites tab you can define any location where inventory is stored for your company. This includes but is not limited to retail stores and warehouses.

Select a site from the list to edit the sites details. Click on the plus button at the top right to add a new inventory site. Enter a name for the site. Be as descriptive as possible as this is how the site will be referred to throughout the program. The description is for some short notes about the site. Select what type of site you are creating. Defining the businesses vehicles as Truck types allows you to keep track of inventory on them and even place items on invoices right from the vehicles.

An optional physical address can be associated to the site in the Street, City, State and Postal code boxes. If there is a particular employee that is responsible for this site, for example a technicianâ€™s work truck, select the employee from the Assigned To pull down.
