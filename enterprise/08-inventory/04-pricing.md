In the Price Levels grid, define as many price levels as needed by entering a Name for the price level and the price. These names can be as generic or specific as you wish and will display as a selection when creating an invoice.

After creating your price levels, select the Default Price in the top selection box to indicate the price this item should default to when added to an invoice.

The Quantity Discounts grid allows you to define discounts given when customers purchase multiples of this item. To create a quantity discount, enter the minimum amount needed to purchase this item to receive a discount and then the price per item when that many are purchased. For example if we want to sell our item for ten cents less per item if a customer buys more than 5, weâ€™ll enter 5 in the quantity and the price 10 cents less than our default price.
