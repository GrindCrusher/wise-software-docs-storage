# Units of Measure

The first tab in settings is Units of Measure. Here we define the relationship of quantities when we purchase items for our inventory to when we sell them. For example, if we purchase a case of items and then break down that case to sell them individually.

Enter a name for the Unit of Measure in the name field. In the Base Unit field enter the lowest or smallest unit type in this unit of measure. This is typically the unit you will sell a product as. In the Unit Abbr field, enter a short reference for this unit of measure. In the related measurements table, you will define multiples of the base unit. For our example, if a case is 12 items, weâ€™ll enter Case as the Related Unit, a short abbreviation for the case, and 12 as the base count to indicate this case is 12 of our base items. In the Sell By enter the date if the product expires. In the Purchase By enter a date for this item to be purchased.

In the Unit of Measure on the right we can select from the units we have previously defined and what units we sell and purchase an item from.
