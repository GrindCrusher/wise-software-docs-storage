# Adjustments

Adjust count or cost of in stock inventory items individually or in bulk.




## Individual
Adjust the count, location or cost of the currently selected item.

### Add
Add a quantity of the currently selected item to stock.

The Add Adjustment screen is broken up into 3 sections:
- **Quantity** - The count of items to be added.
- **Adjustment Details** - Define the Inventory Location to add to and Cost of each item being added. Current quantity and new quantity display and will update as other details are selected.
- **Current Vendor Costs** - This is a list of vendors and their costs as defined in [Inventory Vendors](https://docs.wisesoftwareinc.com/enterprise/inventory/vendors) for quick reference.

### Loss
Deduct a quantity of the currently selected item to stock.

The Loss Adjustment screen displays the quantities of the inventory item currently on hand at each location.
- **Quantity** - Define the count that has been lost for this item at the displayed location. Note the maximum amount that can be set is defined by the on hand amount at that location.

### Move
  
 Edit the amount you want to move. Select the "From Location", keep in mind the maximum will only show what the "From Location" has on hand. Then select the "To Location" where the new quantity will end up.

## Bulk

Clicking on add new item will bring up inventory search. The search will only search products that have a Vendor Number associated with them. Vendor numbers are the unique number defined by the distributor you purchase the product from. To set one up you can go [here](https://docs.wisesoftwareinc.com/enterprise/inventory/vendors).

Once the product is selected, quantity and cost can be adjusted. The amount will be calculated based on the previous 2 values.
 

### Move
  
  Searching and selecting an item is exactly the same as when doing an add. The difference here is there is a "from" location, a "to" location and only the quantity can be changed on the product itself.
