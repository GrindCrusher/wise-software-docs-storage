# Adjustments

For stock items that need an increase or decrease of count or cost there are 2 ways of doing this, individualy or in bulk.




# Individual

There are 4 types of adjustments that can be done on the currently selected item:
- Add

  The add screen is broken up into 3 sections:
   - Quantity
      This is where you define the amount of items to add.
     
   - Location and cost
       Select which inventory site you would like this to. Current quantity and new quantity will change depending on what is currenttly and the site and what the quantity has been set.
     
   - Any current costs
     This is a list of vendors that you buy the product from and can be defined [here](https://docs.wisesoftwareinc.com/enterprise/inventory/settings/sites).
