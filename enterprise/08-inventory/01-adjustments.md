# Adjustments

For stock items that need an increase or decrease of count or cost there are 2 ways of doing this, individualy or in bulk.




# Individual

There are 4 types of adjustments that can be done on the currently selected item:
- Add 
- Loss 
- Cost
- Move

# Bulk

Bulk only only has 2 types;

- Add
- Move
  
  When doing an add there is a location of where the item is going. Clicking on add new item will bring up inventory search. The search will only search products that have a Vendor Number associated with them.
