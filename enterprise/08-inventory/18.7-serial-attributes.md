The Serial Attributes tab is where you can define details that can be tracked on serialized items.

Click on the plus button at the top right to create a new attribute. Name the attribute. Think of this as a label for a selection such as Size or Color. Define the available choices of the attribute in the choices grid. 

Enter all necessary choices by clicking in the gray “click here to add a new item” bar and enter a choice followed by the enter key on your keyboard. To edit a choice, click on it and edit as needed. To delete a choice, select the line by clicking to the far right and then press delete on your keyboard. Note that the delete button will delete the entire attribute, not just the selected choice.
