For example, a different brand of the same chemical, the same size filter cartridge by different manufacturers or a replacement part from a third party. To define substitutes for this item, first find the substitute item in your inventory by entering a term in the search inventory field and press tab or enter on your keyboard. Drag items from the search results on the left to the Current Substitutes area on the right.
