The products shown on this page are the ones you have selected from the inventory details tab of the inventory. There is a selection on the lower right corner that says treatment.

Once you have selected an item for treatment, you will be able to edit the dosage, the per gallons and the size.

This information is usually on the back of the products you are using. For example, the back of the pH UP bottle says something such as "use 16 oz per 10,000 gallons to raise the ph. by â€¦." This is the amount to put for the treatment.
