When relevant, Sync Interval defines how many days in between syncing pricing on a product. The Auto Sync is a switch to turn on or off syncing though this is not used with any of the currently implemented sync accounts. Additional fields may prompt for information depending on the sync account you are setting up. For example, Poolcorp accounts will require your local branch number.
