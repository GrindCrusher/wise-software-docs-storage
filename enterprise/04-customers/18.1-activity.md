# Activity

The activity view has 3 parts, readings, chemicals used and the details of the service stop. When first creating a service sheet the readings list will be empty, clicking on get template will load reading template associated with this body of water. Products used is where the chemicals are accounted for. These are inventory items that have had the treatment toggle button checked on.
