Once pictures are added to Enterprise, they are stored with your customer data and you will be able to access them from wherever you connect from. Pictures are grouped by customer location and you can use drag and drop to move pictures between locations. Click on a pictureâ€™s thumbnail to view it full size and access the details of the picture.
