# NOTES

This is where you can edit customer notes. NOTE: The customer cannot see these notes. They are for your own use.

The Notes tab allows you to document any additional information about a customer or their account for your reference within the program. The Subject is for a name or topic of the note. The subject will also display on the Customer dashboard for quick reference. You can put as much information as necessary in the Description box including full paragraphs and even links to files or web resources. You can filter and search notes by clicking on the funnel at the top of the notes list
