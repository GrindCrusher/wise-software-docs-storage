# SERVICE

Every time you service a pool or spa, you can record the information. Here you can enter chemical readings, check off lists of items, add pictures, notes, and billing information. If you enter information from your phone it will be stored here.

# WORK ORDERS

Here you can edit service orders that can be assigned by calendar to your different employees. A work order can be assigned to multiple people under the Tasks tab. Pictures, invoices, notes, can all be added to the work order. The work order will also show you the equipment at the location.
