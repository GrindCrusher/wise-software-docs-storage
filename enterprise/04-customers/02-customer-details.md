# LOCATIONS

This is where you can edit pool and billing location information. NOTE: You may have unlimited locations for this customer.

![](https://cdn.realsgii2.dev/wise-software-docs/image_21.5560e130.png)

The Location Name is a required field. Fill in name for the address as It will be referenced throughout the program. It is important that an alias be unique within that customer. If the customer’s billing and service addresses are the same location, a Location Name such as “Primary” would make sense. If they have a separate service location than their billing address, they may be named as such “Billing” and “Service”. If a customer has multiple service addresses, the Location Name for each might be based on the street address or city such as “Service Main St” or “Capitol City Location”.

Care Of is an optional field that should be filled in if a Care Of line is needed to direct a billing address to a particular person or department. The program will add this line under the Account name on any address header such as on a Statement.

The Note field is for optional instructions for properly and safely accessing a location. Gate codes, Key locations, or pet warnings would be appropriate here. This will display with the service address to aid a technician while at the location.
