# WORK ORDERS

Work orders unlike service stops are not set to be recurring and will need to be reculary scheduled. Here you can edit work orders that can be assigned by calendar to your different employees. A work order can be assigned to multiple people under the Tasks tab. Pictures, invoices, notes, can all be added to the work order. The work order will also show you the equipment at the location.

The work orders view will also quickly show which have been invoiced and which have been paid.
