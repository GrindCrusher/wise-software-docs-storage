# WORK ORDERS

Work orders unlike service stops are not set to be recurring and will need to be reculary scheduled. Here you can edit work orders that can be assigned by calendar to your different employees. A work order can be assigned to multiple people under the Tasks tab. Pictures, invoices, notes, can all be added to the work order. The work order will also show you the equipment at the location.

# Icons
This GPS view will center around the location to be scheduled. Any activities scheduled for that day will be displayed. The push pins on the map will have differant colors and symbols based on who it is assigned, status, type of work and the techs location. Work order will have a crossed wrench and hammer, while service stops will have a figure with a net cleaning the water. The color of the pin indicates which employee the job is assigned. The outer bubble will indicate status and what # the job is in. The techs location will be a white push pin with a truck in it and the customer location will be a yellow pin with a house in it.
