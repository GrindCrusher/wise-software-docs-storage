Type a SKU into the SKU field and press Tab or Enter for the program to fill in the line automatically from the inventory.

If we know an item is in our inventory but do not have the SKU on hand, we can easily search from the invoice to find the item we are searching for. Simply type a search term into the SKU field and press tab or enter.

Then on the search result screen, click the item you want to add to your invoice

Once an item is on the invoice you can edit the quantity of the line if multiple of the same item are to be charged. The inventory site the item was sold from defaults based on the local settings but can be updated in the Site column. The description can be edited as needed. The taxability of the line will default based on the inventory entry, if needed, use the pulldown to change it. In the Price column, you can modify the per item price of this line item. And lastly in the Discount column, define a flat rate or percentage discount. The line's total will update in the Amount column as these changes are made.

The program saves the invoice as you edit it so once you have set the details and entered all items onto the invoice, you are done.
