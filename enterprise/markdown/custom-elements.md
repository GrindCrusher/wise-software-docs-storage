# Custom Elements

A run down of elements I extended Markdown with.

# YouTube Video

I included this in case you'd like to include video tutorials on documentation pages. You can embed using `@youtube[ID]` on a blank line (i.e. `@youtube[dQw4w9WgXcQ]`).

@youtube[dQw4w9WgXcQ]

# Callouts

Callouts are used to highlight important information. They are stateful.

?> Tip callout, written with `?>`

!> Warning callout, written with `!>`

x> Destructive callout, written with `x>`
