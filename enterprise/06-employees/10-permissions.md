# PERMISSIONS

All permissions are scoped to a licensed user. A licensed user is an employee that has a paid seat.
The 3 sections are broken up by Desktop, Mobile & Retail (note you must have a retail license to see these permissions).

# Desktop

The desktop side of permissions will have a drop down with either 3 or 4 options.
The options are:

- No Access
- Read access
- Write Access
- Delete Access
- Full Access    *This pertains to modules that have a settings option i.e. Billing, Customers, Inventory and Payroll.

Reports will only have No Access or Read Access

# Mobile
  
Mobile permissions will inherit desktop permissions for reading, editing and deleting items outside of work order or service stops. It also has 3 specialized permissions to hide contacts, allow the tech to optimize thier own service stops & work orders and to submit orders to Pool360.
*For route optimization you will need a Wise Software GPD license.

# Retail
Retail has its own set up of permissions.
