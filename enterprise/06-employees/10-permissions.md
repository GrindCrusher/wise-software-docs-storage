# PERMISSIONS

All permissions are scoped to a licensed user. A licensed user is an employee that has a paid seat.
The 3 sections are broken up by Desktop, Mobile & Retail (note you must have a retail license to see these permissions).

The desktop side of permissions will have a drop down with either 3 or 4 options.
The options are:

- No Access
- Read access
- Write Access
- Delete Access
- Full Access    *This pertains to modules that have a settings option i.e. Billing, Customers, Inventory and Payroll.

  Reports will only have No Access or Read Access
