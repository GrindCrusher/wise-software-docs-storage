# Recurring Emails
A recurring email group is where a group of customers can be assigned a monthly automatic email.
To set up an email group you first need to go to the billing module.

Then you need to pull the tab at the bottom or right click and then click on settings.

Next click on emails. This will bring you to the email groups. To create a new email group, click on the + in the upper right corner.

This will open the Recurring Wizard.

First create a name for the email group. This name is for your use only to help keep the group organized. You will not be able to continue to the next screen until the group has a name.

Next decide if you want the email to send out statements or invoices. Select your choice in the drop down.

Next you will chose the seperator (for statements) and the billing note.

Next select the parameters on the right side of the screen. Each choice has details explaining what they do.

After you have selected the settings on this page and entered a name, click next to go to the next screen.

On this screen you need to enter the email date. 

Next select which month you want the email to send the billing for. Each option has an explanation. Once you have selected the desired options, click finish. This will save and create the new email group.
