This is where you'll give customers credits or process refunds.




The process is the same as making an invoice, first click on the plus sign in the upper right corner of the screen. Then fill in the date, tax group. Now you can click on the Click here to add a new item and fill in your credit details. If you would like to keep the credit on your customer's profile to redeem for a future service or purchase, nothing else needs to be done. The credit will appear on their Dashboard and you can apply it to a future payment.

If you would like to refund money click on the line with amount you would like and then click on the dollar sign in the upper right hand corner of the screen. You can then choose to refund them by cash, check, processor, or vault.
