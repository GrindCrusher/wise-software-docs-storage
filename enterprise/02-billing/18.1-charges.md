# Recurring Charges

A recurring group is where a group of customers can be assigned a monthly or other frequency charge.

To create a recurring group you first need a template. This is set up in inventory.

# Inventory

Setting up recurring is a multi-step process. An inventory item needs to exist so that it can be used and tracked for any recurring charges.
