# Recurring Charges
Setting up recurring is a multi-step process. An inventory item need to exist so that it can be used and tracked for any recurring charges.

# Inventory
The first part of this process is setting up an inventory item to be used in recurring(newer datase will already have a default item to be used). In this example we will use an item called Regular Monthly Service. It is important to note that the name should be generic so it can be used multiple times, this will become clear latter in the process. A couple of examples is "Monthly Service" or "Full Chem Service".

The inventory type must be set to "Service". The other properties can be set to what is ever needed. Pricing will not play a big factor in what the end result will be.

# Adding Recurring Group

There are 2 quick action buttons, the first is for adding charges to customer in bulk the other is for adding a new recurring group.

After clicking the new button a walk-through wizard will prompt for the selection
on 1 or more invenotry items. Becuase you can select multiple items this allows for having multi-lined invoices to be generated.
