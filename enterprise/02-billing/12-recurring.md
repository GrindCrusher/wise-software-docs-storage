# Adding Recurring Group
To add this Group to a customer address, just drag the Group to the address on the right of the screen. Now set the start date the day the billing should start. The end date should only be filled in when you want the service to stop. 

If you haven't set up a recurring group, the walk-through can be found [here](https://docs.wisesoftwareinc.com/enterprise/billing/settings/charges)

# Deleting Recurring Group

To remove the group just drag the charge from the customer address back to the charge list. Also, when the end date is met the recurrung charge will be removed from the customers address automatically.


Make as many groups as you need to cover the different recurring charges.

# Adding Email Group
Choose what contacts get emails automatically. Adding emails to a contact is very similiar to adding charges.
