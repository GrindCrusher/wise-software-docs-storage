The invoice header drop down can be set for none, description, or address. If you set it to none, no invoice details will be shown on the statement; only the descriptions and prices from your invoice will show. If you select description, all of the invoice details (Invoice number, Invoice date. Description and price.) will show on the statement. If you select address, any address you have entered in you locations will show on each line if you have multiple locations for this customer.
