# DASHBOARD

![](https://cdn.realsgii2.dev/wise-software-docs/image_2.46219917.png)

The Billing area dashboard is divided into three main sections.

At the top left you will find the customer's billing address with status icons underneath. From left to right, the icons are Recurring Charges, Automated Email, Automatic Payments, and Pay Now status. If the icon is lit up, it means the customer has that specific feature turned on. To the right of that box you will see the customer's current balance and available credit.




In the center is the Billing History for the customer that shows open and paid invoices over a period of time, Check payments, credit card payments and cash payments.

Across the top of the screen (except for the dashboard) you'll find tabs for the customer whose name is at the top of the screen. At the top right of each tab there will be a plus and a garbage can icon. The plus is for adding new information, the garbage can is for deletion.
