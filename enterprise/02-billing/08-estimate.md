This estimate tab is where you'll provide customers quotes for services or items. This works the same as an invoice except it will be saved in the invoice area and inventory will not be deleted from inventory until you create an invoice from this estimate. As always, fill in the description and provide a dollar amount. You may email the estimate to your customer by clicking the email button.

Once an estimate is accepted you can create an invoice by clicking on the double arrows at the top right of the screen. The estimate will not be deleted. It can only be deleted by selecting the garbage can at the upper right of the screen.
