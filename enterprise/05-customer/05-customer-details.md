The Customer area is where you can add, edit, and delete customer information.

From here you can edit account information, locations, contacts, equipment, notes, pictures, pools, service, and work orders.

Across the top of the screen you'll find tabs for the customer whose name is at the top of the screen. At the top right of each tab there will be a plus and a garbage can icon. The plus is for adding new information, the garbage can is for deletion.

The customer area is divided into easy sections for you to see the most important information.

On the left side of the Dashboard you will find the billing and service locations, contact information, and account information. Selecting the Locations drop-down will display contact and equipment information for each location.

Center of the screen will show you a picture of the pool with service days on the bar on top of the picture with the equipment listed in a box below. Mousing over the calendar dates will show you the person servicing the pool on that day. Click on a piece of equipment to see the details right from the dashboard.

On the right side of the screen you'll see three blue boxes. The top blue box will show service history, the next blue box will show customer notes, and the last will show the billing history.


# Adding New Customers

Clicking on the plus icon on the upper right hand corner will allow you to add a new customer to the program. Clicking on the trash can icon will delete the customer. NOTE: You can delete only if there's no information attached to the customer.


# Account Information

This is where you'll edit the account name, service type, and other account information.

If the customer is participating in your Rewards program, select their Reward Level from the Rewards drop-down. See our video on Customer Settings for how to define Reward Levels.

Select the Type for the customer from the second drop-down. Customer types are used as subsets of customers for billing output. See our video on Customer Settings for how to create or edit Customer Types.

Use the Tax Code drop-down to tell the system if this customer pays tax when sold a taxable product. The selected tax rate should be based on selling the customer a product at their service location.

A unique Account Number will be generated by the program for your new customer or you may enter your own.

You may assign them a custom account number and a global discount can be given to the customer by putting a percentage into the Discount field. This will automatically assign this discount to all items added to invoices. NOTE: This will not affect automatically recurring charges.

Assign a Billing Method to the customer by clicking the drop-down, either Print or Email, to tell the program how to output this customer in bulk billings. Note that this setting affects only bulk output and that you can print or email any individual customer’s invoices or statement no matter what this is set to.

Click the Status drop-down if you need to change the customer’s status. An inactive status will Hide this customer out of day to day operations and off most reports. Set a customer to Collections to flag the account as such.

Late fees can be turned on per customer in Enterprise. If this customer is to receive an additional fee when an invoice is past due, check the Late Fee check box. See our video on Billing Settings for how to define your late fees.

You have the option to assign this customer to one of your specific stores or company's if you operate out of more than one location by clicking on the Home Location drop-down.

Lastly, you will find the Pay Now option drop-down if your customer has opted in. Note this is only operational if you have a credit card service.

  
# Locations

This is where you can edit pool and billing location information. NOTE: You may have unlimited locations for this customer.

The Alias is a required field. Fill in name for the address as It will be referenced throughout the program. It is important that an alias be unique within that customer. If the customer’s billing and service addresses are the same location, an Alias such as “Primary” would make sense. If they have a separate service location than their billing address, they may be named as such “Billing” and “Service”. If a customer has multiple service addresses, the Alias for each might be based on the street address or city such as “Service Main St” or “Capitol City Location”.

Care Of is an optional field that should be filled in if a Care Of line is needed to direct a billing address to a particular person or department. The program will add this line under the Account name on any address header such as on a Statement.

The Note field is for optional instructions for properly and safely accessing a location. Gate codes, Key locations, or pet warnings would be appropriate here. This will display with the service address to aid a technician while at the location.

The Primary Location checkbox is to indicate the main billing address for this account. This tells the program where any mailings (print or email) will go to. Each account can only have one Primary Location.

  
# Contacts

This is where you can edit customer contact information, email, and phone numbers. NOTE: You may have unlimited contacts for each account.

The Contacts tab is where you keep track of the people associated with an account. Note that contacts are attached to locations so you will not be able to add contacts until you have created at least one location.

Select an existing contact to edit and delete the information. Click the plus button in the upper right hand corner to add a new contact.

Enter the contacts First and Last name into these fields. These fields are required. If these are left blank the information will not save.

Use the location drop-down to select the location to tie this contact to. The Primary Contact checkbox indicates this is the primary contact for the selected location. Each location can only have one Primary Contact.

Enter the primary email for this contact in the Email 1 field. When an email is generated for this customer, the Email 1 from the Primary Contact of the Primary Billing Location will be used. The Email 2 field is for a secondary email for reference as needed.

# Work Orders

Here you can edit service orders that can be assigned by calendar to your different employees. A work order can be assigned to multiple people under the Tasks tab. Pictures, invoices, notes, can all be added to the work order. The work order will also show you the equipment at the location.
