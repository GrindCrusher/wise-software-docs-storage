Welcome to the documentation website I built for you. It's mostly bare-bones at the moment, but I'm willing to add features you need.

The way it was designed was to be quick, free, and easy to manage. These documentation pages are written in Markdown, stored on a GitHub repository. To take a look at all the Markdown features this website supports, take a look at [the Elements page](/enterprise/markdown/elements). 

Merry Christmas!
