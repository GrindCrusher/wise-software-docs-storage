# Status

The status view is an optional add-on with the Wise Software GPS services. It can be accessed from the App bar by right clicking or clicking the bottom of the screen. It provides realtime updates on all route stops, work orders and tech locations.

For a tech to show up on the list they need to be set to active and tech under the [employee details](https://docs.wisesoftwareinc.com/enterprise/employees/details). Updates are provided as the techs update stops or work orders and every 10 - 15 minutes. When an event occurs the push pins will reflect the changes and a notification will appear at the top of view stating what change occcured by who.


# Pushpins
Push pin colors are derived from the employee color, which can be set on the [employee details](https://docs.wisesoftwareinc.com/enterprise/employees/details). There are 2 icon types on the pushpins:

  - Route Stop     ![](https://wiselibrary.blob.core.windows.net/docs/Windows/RoutePushPin.png)
    
  - Work Order     ![](https://wiselibrary.blob.core.windows.net/docs/Windows/WorkPushPin.png)

The color of the bubble on the outside indicates the status of the job, they use the same color scheme as the statuses on a work order. Here is a list of the possible statuses:

- Not Started
- In Porgress
- Completed
- Overdue
- To Do
- Deferred

  The number indicates which order the route is in for that tech.

# Filtering

Stops and work orders can be filter per tech by checking or unchecking the radio buttons on the tech list.
