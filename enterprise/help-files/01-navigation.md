Hello and welcome to this Wise Software Enterprise training video. In this session, we will cover Navigating the program.







Navigation and Search



Dashboard – When first logging in the user is greeted with the User Dashboard



This dashboard gives quick access to employee specific jobs for the day including Service Stop, Work Orders, Reminders and Tasks.



Quick Action Buttons



In the top right of most screens you will find Quick Action Buttons



This is where a user has access to screen specific functions such as Add, Delete, and Print.

If you are in the Activities Dashboard the user can quickly Log Out, access Local Settings, or Change their Password.



Navigation Bar



Off to the left we have the Navigation bar. This always available menu allows a user to jump to any module in the program.



Hover over any of the icons on the Navigation bar to display the name of that module



Use the Hamburger top icon to toggle a fully expanded view of the menu



Customer Search



Navigating to most modules for the first time after logging in will prompt you with that module’s specific search.



For a Customer Search, enter all or part of an Account Name, Address, Account number, or Contact information and press tab or enter to start your search



For example, searching Linda will bring up any customers on Linda Flora Drive and our customer Linda Evans.



Use the arrow icon next to each result in the search data to expand and view secondary address information right from the search.



Clicking on the account name will take you to that account.



Inventory Search



In Inventory, Search by Item Name, Description, local SKU, Manufacturer Part Number, Category



For example, searching for shock will bring up all category's with the name shook and any inventory name the have the word shook in them



We can use the funnel icons in the column headers to filter down the results



We can use filter down the Category column to Chemicals to easily find the product we are looking for.



Expand results here will show stock counts at our different locations.



Similar powerful searches are available throughout the program including the Employee and Vendor modules

App bars are located on the bottom of the program.

Right clicking your mouse will bring up the App Bar at the bottom of the window
